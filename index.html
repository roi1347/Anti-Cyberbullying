      >What is cyberbullying?</h1>
        <p>Cyberbullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person.
             Online threats and mean, aggressive, or rude texts, tweets, posts, or messages all count. 
             So does posting personal information, pictures, or videos designed to hurt or embarrass someone else.
             Cyberbullying occurs when someone utilizes a computer, game console, smartphone, or any other device with
              internet or social media access to harass, 
             stalk, or abuse another person by starting or taking part in online hate campaigns. 
             Even though the majority of media coverage suggests that cyberbullying only occurs on social media, 
             it is a major issue in the online gaming community as well.

>what can we do to stop cyberbullying?</h1>
  <p>To effectively stop cyberbullying, a collaborative effort is essential. Education plays a crucial role: individuals must be informed about
     the impact of cyberbullying and encouraged to practice empathy and respect online. Parents and guardians should actively monitor their children's 
     online activities and provide guidance on safe and responsible internet use. Schools need comprehensive anti-bullying programs that specifically address 
     cyberbullying, teaching students about digital citizenship and providing support to victims. Social media platforms and online communities must enforce 
     strict policies against cyberbullying, offering easy reporting mechanisms and taking swift action against offenders. Legal measures should also
      be strengthened to hold perpetrators accountable. Ultimately, fostering a culture of kindness, 
    promoting positive online behavior, and providing support to victims are all integral to combatting cyberbullying effectively.

  <div class="info"
>What is the main cause of cyberbullying?</h1>
  <p>The main cause of cyberbullying is often rooted in the anonymity and detachment provided by digital 
    platforms. Unlike face-to-face interactions, online communication can mask a persons identity, making it easier
     for individuals to engage in harmful behavior without immediate consequences. This detachment reduces empathy and
      accountability, which can embolden people to say or do things they might avoid in real life. Additionally, the accessibility
       and wide reach of social media and other online tools amplify the impact of bullying, allowing harmful messages and actions 
       to spread quickly and reach a larger audience. The combination of anonymity, reduced empathy, and the expansive nature of 
       digital communication creates an environment where cyberbullying can thrive.

>what age group is mainly targeted from cyberbullying?</h1>
  <p>Cyberbullying predominantly affects adolescents and young adults. This age group, 
    typically ranging from 10 to 24 years old, is particularly vulnerable due to their high 
    engagement with social media and digital platforms. Teenagers and young adults often experience peer pressure, a strong desire
     for social validation, and ongoing social development, making them susceptible to online harassment and bullying. The constant
      connectivity and visibility on social media amplify these experiences, leading to increased instances of cyberbullying within
       this demographic.
